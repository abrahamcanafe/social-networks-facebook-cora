# Social Network Mining
Project that explores various properties of social networks from [SNAP's Facebook dataset](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html) and the [Cora dataset](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA). Part of a group project for the Large Scale Social and Complex Networks: Design and Algorithms course at UCLA (Spring 2023). While this project was relatively simple, I managed to appreciate the extra R practice.

## Built With
* R
  * igraph
* Python
  * PyTorch
  * PyTorch Geometric
* Jupyter Notebook

## Additional Notes
* [Tutorial on how to run Jupyter notebooks in R.](https://izoda.github.io/site/anaconda/r-jupyter-notebook/#:~:text=To%20run%20a%20Jupyter%20Notebook,R%20language%20in%20a%20notebook.&text=Copy%20the%20generated%20URL%20and,leave%20the%20appropriate%20machine%20name)
* The R- and Python-based Jupyter notebooks can also be run on Google Colab.

## Project Details
* The [R notebook](https://github.com/abrahamcanafe/social-networks-facebook-cora/blob/main/ECE_232E_Project2_Facebook_Q1_15.ipynb) exploring the Facebook dataset creates personalized networks from the Facebook dataset and analyzes various aspects of the networks and their community structures.
* The [Python notebook](https://github.com/abrahamcanafe/social-networks-facebook-cora/blob/main/ECE_232E_Project2_Cora_GCN_Q23.ipynb) constructs a 3-layer graph convolutional network (GCN) that is used to classify the graph-based Cora dataset.
